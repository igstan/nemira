How does habituation affect design?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you can’t answer these questions, you need to get yourself a copy of \u003ca href\u003d\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humane_Interface\"\u003eThe Humane Interface\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.amazon.com/How-We-Decide-Jonah-Lehrer/dp/0618620117\"\u003eHow We Decide\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.amazon.com/Resonant-Interface-Foundations-Interaction-Design/dp/0321375963\"\u003eThe Resonant Interface\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I’m hiring, I don’t look for credentials, I look for knowledge.

That’s dangerous. Your gut can often lead you in the right direction, but it can also make stupid and avoidable mistakes. Potentially worse, you won’t be able to communicate and convince others of your ideas because you can only argue with feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterface design is as much a science as it is an art. Know the science, else you are walking blindly through a minefield of harmful design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e3.

The same is true for companies that schism their designers and engineers. The most important trait a team can have is empathy. Without it, the implementers will not care, and the designers will not be realistic. When companies complain of specs and code being “tossed over the fence”, a lack of empathy is to blame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most powerful tool for creating empathy as a designer is prototyping. It meets the rest of the team half-way, is the second most persuasive artifact (the first being a narrated video of the prototype), and gives you a sense of what’s hard and what’s easy to implement. Having thought through the edge-cases and being able to speak an engineer’s language gives you street cred. You don’t need to be a great coder, but you should at least be able to get your idea across in in HTML and Javascript.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo design is to inspire participation. To do that, you need to be respected. For that, you need to be a designer-coder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e4. Create, Create, Create.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat designers do design all of the time. They get mad in an elevator when the buttons are in a confusion order, or when the buttons on a ATM are incorrectly labeled. Then they take a picture and blog about it. If you don’t love creating and designing, you shouldn’t be in the field. You’ll need thousands of hours of practice to rise to the top of your game. In the end, you are designing for people so you need to intimately know people, and people are messy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you don’t have dozens of little projects you’ve created, learned from, and even discarded, you are doing it wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e5. Study Graphic Design.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to be a hard-nosed interaction designer, and eschewed visual design in favor of experience design. While it is true that getting interaction right requires a deeper understanding of human psychology, a read through \u003ci\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Design-Love-Everyday-Things/dp/0465051359\"\u003eEmotional Design\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/i\u003e shows that looks matter. Looks affect usability.

VPR’s Online Manager, Jonathan Butler, wrote a blog post about how the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://vprblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/new-vprnet-homepage.html\"\u003eredesigned homepage delivers more content to VPR.net visitors.\u003c/a\u003e Here I’ll talk about the technology behind this new homepage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAtom Syndication Format\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of VPR’s web content is currently stored in a proprietary content management system (CMS). The first step was publishing the needed content from the CMS out into an open format. VPR’s Dan Allen published from the CMS \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.atomenabled.org/\"\u003eAtom\u003c/a\u003e feeds of the various content we would need for the new homepage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003ePHP and Zend Framework\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we had the needed Atom feeds, we created a \u003ca href\u003d\"http://framework.zend.com/\"\u003eZend Framework\u003c/a\u003e web application to import these feeds. Components such as \u003ca href\u003d\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.feed.reader.html\"\u003eZend_Feed_Reader\u003c/a\u003e made the job easier. The weather data comes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Weather Service’s \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.weather.gov/forecasts/xml/rest.php\"\u003eNational Digital Forecast Database XML/REST Service\u003c/a\u003e. The market data comes from the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://code.google.com/apis/finance/\"\u003eGoogle Finance API\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCouchDB\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the data (except for weather, which is pulled directly with a bit of caching) is stored in \u003ca href\u003d\"http://couchdb.apache.org/\"\u003eCouchDB\u003c/a\u003e. Since we’re storing documents with varying metadata (i.e. Atom entries) choosing a document-oriented database made a lot of sense. CouchDB’s map/reduce views make for very efficient queries. Its RESTful HTTP API provides a lot of options for scaling and caching. We’re caching documents within the Zend Framework application and conditionally requesting these documents from CouchDB with ETags when a cache is available. The current cache is simply file-based but we’re considering using \u003ca href\u003d\"http://memcached.org/\"\u003eMemcached\u003c/a\u003e for even better performance. On a related note, the homepage itself also supports conditional HTTP requests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eApache and nginx\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had the pleasure of working with another great Vermont company, \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.clearbearing.com/\"\u003eClearBearing\u003c/a\u003e, on this project. ClearBearing handles the infrastructure layer for \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.vpr.net/\"\u003eVPR.net\u003c/a\u003e. The current website was (and still is) served up by \u003ca href\u003d\"http://httpd.apache.org/\"\u003eApache\u003c/a\u003e. ClearBearing already had \u003ca href\u003d\"http://nginx.org/\"\u003enginx\u003c/a\u003e in place as a reverse proxy to handle caching. Since we weren’t replacing the entire CMS we needed a way for the existing CMS and this new application to coexist. We decided to host the new application separately (still administered by ClearBearing) and reverse proxy requests for certain URIs (primarily the homepage) to the new application. This provides a clean separation between the new application and the existing CMS while still allowing for them to be hosted on the same domain from an end-user perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eLicensing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll notice that all of the standards used are open standards and all of the technologies used are free and open source software. Additionally, all of the code we have written for VPR is licensed to them under the permissive \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php\"\u003eNew BSD License\u003c/a\u003e. This means that VPR is free to use this code however they want, study and modify the code, and redistribute the code as-is or modified. They can do all of this without paying additional licensing fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eDesign\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this post is primarily about the technology behind VPR’s new homepage, I should mention that Found Line’s \u003ca href\u003d\"http://foundline.com/people/jason-pelletier\"\u003eJason Pelletier\u003c/a\u003e designed the new homepage and implemented all of its HTML and CSS. We worked closely with Jonathan Butler and John Van Hoesen, Vice President for News \u0026amp; Programming, to make sure the new design meets the needs of website visitors and the organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eNext Steps\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe launch of this new homepage was just one iteration with many more to come. As Jonathan Butler mentioned in his blog post, VPR has plans to further improve online services for their listeners. Look for a redesigned VPR Classical page soon. There are also plans for better mobile access to VPR and VPR Classical programming. Fortunately much of the work that has been done can be leveraged to create additional online services for VPR’s listeners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA special thanks for the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.vpr.net/support/\"\u003esupport of VPR’s listeners\u003c/a\u003e—you made this new homepage possible!

Really; it’s as simple as that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you feel it would be cool to meet up with other front-end engineers and discuss geeky stuff, show off your latest design, or just commiserate about IE6 over a few beers, chances are other front-enders will feel exactly the same and will react enthusiastically when you propose to meet up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI told all this to Lea and the Italian, and both agreed in principle but pointed out that it was so hard to get the message out there. They had blogs, but one was fairly unknown and the other mostly read by foreigners. But when I pressed them they admitted to knowing popular bloggers, and on further reflection agreed these bloggers might be willing to spread the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHell, I’ll spread the word if you write a blog post and \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.quirksmode.org/contact.html\"\u003egive me\u003c/a\u003e a link, a date, and a city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eA meet-up\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo do it. Pick a pub with no loud music, pick a night when it’s relatively quiet, tell people about it, approach well-known bloggers from your part of the woods to spread the word, and sit together, have a few drinks, and talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSure, the first time only ten people might show up. But a good time will be had by all, and when you repeat it one or two months later, twenty people will show up. And the next time even more, or somebody else will organise something similar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe real revelation comes a bit later, when you find you’ve missed a good meet-up but realise that \u003cem\u003eit does not matter\u003c/em\u003e because another meet-up will come. You’ll discover you have a thriving meet-up ecosystem in your very own town that will go on no matter what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes surprisingly little energy to kick-start the process. Keeping it running is a whole lot more work; certainly once the first excitement wears off and it becomes just another volunteer job. But even if you don’t feel up to it, somebody else in your town might. But you first have to get him or her excited by organising that all-important first meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eMeetings at companies\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Italian asked about getting a local company to host a meeting. Here in the Netherlands we do that all the time, but I advised him not to follow our example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://fronteers.nl\"\u003eFronteers\u003c/a\u003e organises roughly one meeting per month with about 40 to 60 people. Usually a meeting runs from 18:00 to 22:00 and is hosted by a local web company that arranges some light refreshments and snacks as well as projectors and such. We have two main speakers who each talk for half an hour to an hour, and afterwards there’s beer and geeky talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsually we are contacted by a front-ender employed by the host company. Central planner \u003ca href\u003d\"http://arjaneising.nl/\"\u003eArjan Eising\u003c/a\u003e arranges a few details, most importantly avoiding planning clashes with other meetings, and sometimes one or both speakers. The brunt of the organisation generally lies with the person who contacted us. Occasionally we provide modest financial assistance; for instance for student groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a fun format; clearly one step above the informal meet-up, but still easy to arrange and short enough to do after working hours. (Incidentally, we’re \u003ca href\u003d\"http://fronteers.nl/bijeenkomsten/organiseren\"\u003elooking for\u003c/a\u003e host companies for our next few meetings.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I do not advise you to copy this format. The danger exists that the first host company would try to unduly influence the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere at home I avoided that by reaching out to the lead front-end engineers of many of the largest web companies and capture their interest with the Fronteers concept. They convinced their bosses and hosted the first Fronteers meetings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThus Fronteers was an equal partner to all host companies from the start, and that is an absolute requirement for this format to succeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese initial circumstances depended largely on my personal status in the web world; I could easily unite those people that were interested in a formal organisation, and thus we had a quite powerful group that could discuss stuff on an equal footing with web companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eInviting speakers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the advantage of being a Great Name primarily lies in this kind of political stuff. It does not help a lot when it comes to organising conference — well, a little bit, but not nearly as much as people seem to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs I explained to Georgi, there is no black magic involved in getting Great Names to speak at your conference. You don’t need to be well-known, your conference does not need to be well-known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, you just shoot them an email. Really, that’s all there is to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome conference organisers are afraid of doing that for reasons I don’t understand. \u003ca href\u003d\"http://adactio.com\"\u003eJeremy Keith\u003c/a\u003e won’t laugh at you if you ask him to speak; \u003ca href\u003d\"http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/\"\u003eAndy Clarke\u003c/a\u003e won’t hard-boil you. \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.wait-till-i.com/\"\u003eChris Heilmann\u003c/a\u003e \u003cem\u003ewill\u003c/em\u003e bite you, but only in an affectionate sort of way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEvery speaker worth his or her salt will take your request completely seriously. They like public speaking and conferences; that’s why they do it so often. So considering another request is part of their job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are really only three rules for inviting a Great Name to your conference:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eYou send the invitation at least six and preferably nine months in advance of the conference.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eYou arrange and pay for their flight and hotel.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eYou don’t force them to comply with all kinds of bureaucratic rules. They will \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e submit their presentation a month in advance. They want to be trusted.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf those rules are satisfied your request is serious and will be considered seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat doesn’t mean everybody will say Yes. They might have other commitments around that time, or try to get their traveling time down, or may not consider themselves the best match for your conference. Still, they’ll always reply to say why they can’t make it and be courteous throughout the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eVaclav Stoupa invited me to speak at \u003ca href\u003d\"http://webexpo.cz/en/\"\u003eWebExpo\u003c/a\u003e, and Damian Wielgosik did the same for \u003ca href\u003d\"http://front-trends.com/\"\u003eFront Trends\u003c/a\u003e. I’d never heard of Vaclav or Damian, but that didn’t matter. Their conferences looked good, their invitation came well on time, they were paying my flight and hotel, and I didn’t have any previous commitments around those dates. So I said Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat was back in January. Then I decided to cut down on my conference schedule in 2010, so when several others asked me I said No in the politest way possible. I promised one of them to speak at her conference next year because I really want to go there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s how it works. Person to person. No black magic involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eWave of conferences\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA wave of web conferences is spreading over Europe. The UK had pride of place with the iconic @media 2005; the next year France followed with Paris Web. As far as I know my own Fronteers 2008 came next (leave a comment if I’m wrong), and nowadays most European countries have their own web conference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what we need. Web design and development must be taken seriously as a separate technical discipline, in the minds of both outsiders and of web developers themselves. Conferences are an excellent way of doing that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost well-known speakers keep an eye on the burgeoning European web conference ecosystem. In fact, \u003ca href\u003d\"http://crockford.com/\"\u003eDouglas Crockford\u003c/a\u003e once told me explicitly he’s looking for conferences in Eastern Europe. So give the man a guided tour next year. He’ll love it. And he’ll speak at your conference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eLet me know\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI’m curious. Please tell me where you live, and whether there’s a formal conference or a series of informal meet-ups in your neck of the woods. And if there’s nothing, organise something. Organising a meet-up doesn’t take that much time, and it’s fun. And \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.quirksmode.org/contact.html\"\u003etell me\u003c/a\u003e; I’m willing to spread the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re from an English-speaking country or from the Netherlands, please do \u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e reply. I want to know about the situation in other countries.\u003c/p\u003e"

Simon Pieters and I also wrote blog posts for this release to explain \u003ca href\u003d\"http://my.opera.com/core/blog/websockets\"\u003eWebSockets in Opera\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"http://my.opera.com/core/blog/eventsource\"\u003eThe long journey of Server-Sent Events\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServer-Sent Events is a stable feature at this point. The WebSocket API is too. The WebSocket Protocol is unclear. Opera implements what is known as the -76 version of the WebSocket Protocol, following Chrome 6 and betas of Firefox 4. Safari supports -76 since Safari 5.0.2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe WebSocket Protocol was initially developed by the WHATWG as part of HTML5 and then it moved to the IETF HyBi WG. Since not everyone was happy with the protocol a plan was set out a couple of months ago to come up with a better base protocol in four weeks so all vendors could quickly update their implementations before we got stuck — after a feature has been deployed by multiple vendors in interoperable fashion it becomes very hard to change course. This never happened. Updates have been published, but nothing concrete yet and with the discussions that are currently ongoing it does not seem like anything conclusive will arrive soon either. It will be interesting to see if we ever do get rid of -76.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

Meaning that websites rely on these features working in the “wrong way.” The flip-side is that the “wrong way” really is the “better way.” Not throwing exceptions and making things just work is much nicer for developers and having to separately invoke \u003ccode\u003ehasAttribute()\u003c/code\u003e to see whether an attribute exists is not too great either.

Actually, I receive tons of\nemails every single day about Symfony and my other Open-Source projects (with a raising number of Git pull requests... keep them\ncoming by the way).

It’s becoming more common to build an API, in addition to using them. For all of those of you who are just getting your feet wet with this process, data portability service Gnip has shared \u003ca href\u003d\"http://blog.gnip.com/from-api-consumers-to-api-designers-a-wish-list/\"\u003ea few pointers\u003c/a\u003e to keep you on the straight and narrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUse Standard HTTP Response Codes\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePublish Your Rate Limits\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUse Friendly Ids, Not System Ids\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAllow Us to Limit Response Data\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eKeep Your Docs Up to Date\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePublish Your Search Parameter Constraints\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUse Your Mailing List\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg title\u003d\"Thumbs Up\" src\u003d\"http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/292642699_8e8a8b5aa8_t.jpg\" alt\u003d\"\" width\u003d\"69\" height\u003d\"100\"\u003eOne rule of thumb that stands out is to use standard response codes.

This can save bandwidth and is more standards-compliant, and therefore more predictable to code against.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there’s a really important note too about keeping documentation up to date. It’s so important that it’s a matter of life and death (of your API). So, try to stay on top of the docs and read our \u003ca href\u003d\"http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/08/12/web-api-documentation-best-practices/\"\u003eWeb API Documentation Best Practices\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll be able to build a much happier community around your tools if you provide them with a clear set of instructions and an open channel of positive communication.

About 250 pages.  (Here’s a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.packtpub.com/mysql-5-1-plugins-development/book\"\u003elink to the publisher’s site\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis book is well worth reading for anyone interested in MySQL internals.  I learned a lot from it.  It is well-written and understandable.  I cannot say that I’m planning to write storage engines or more advanced plugins, but I have a great many ideas how to improve MySQL, and I now understand more clearly which of those are suitable to write as plugins, and of what type of plugin is appropriate.  I also think I have a better idea how much work these various ideas might involve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe book begins with an orientation to building plugins on various platforms.  Next it covers user-defined functions (UDFs).  I have written UDFs, but that’s as far as I have gone with MySQL plugins.  The rest of the book covers Daemon plugins, INFORMATION_SCHEMA plugins, full-text parser plugins, and storage engine plugins from basic to advanced.  The last example is a nearly complete storage engine built on Tokyo Cabinet, with some pretty advanced functionality.  It finishes with a quick overview of the types of plugins available in development and future versions of MySQL, and what’s possible in MariaDB.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe examples are full code listings, with paragraphs of text alternating with a few lines of code.  It’s like reading a really well-commented C program, like reading InnoDB source, but with even more explanations.  You can download everything you need to build and run the examples yourself — even the sample images used for demonstrating full-text search of EXIF data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI enjoyed reading about what’s possible in MariaDB.  I had not kept up-to-date with the work that’s being done there.  If I were a storage engine developer, I’m sure I would appreciate what MariaDB has done.  I would speculate that many of the people who’ve written in-house custom storage engines for their own businesses might find MariaDB interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think that anyone who is planning to modify the MySQL source code should read this book.  It could save a lot of work and show easier ways to do things.  I learned a lot about the MySQL source code that I have not gotten from other places.
